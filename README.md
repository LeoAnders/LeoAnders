<h3>Backend Developer</h3>

I am a backend developer, focused on REST APIs, mainly using Node.js. Currently, I concentrate my efforts on architectures for mobile applications, applying good development practices and studying React Native to expand my role in the mobile ecosystem, while keeping backend as my main technical domain. At the same time, I am pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering, deepening my knowledge in systems engineering, design patterns, and agile methodologies.
